== PROJECT: ZeroToOne

== Overview

ZeroToOne is a desktop application that serves as an all-in-one exercise tracker and personal aide. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 26 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: I implemented the Scheduler core feature of ZeroToOne.

** What it does: allows the user to schedule workout sessions.

** Justification: this feature is essential to the product as it enable user to make plans of their workout sessions, stick to the plans and finally achieve a life transformation.

** Highlights: this feature affects efficiency and responsiveness if not implemented correctly. It required careful consideration and analysis of design alternatives. The implementation itself was challenging because it required implementation of a fairly complex model as well as its storage.

* *Minor enhancement*: Created a DateTime class and its utility functions for team members' usage to standardize datetime formatting across the app and compare different datetime objects easily.



* *Code contributed on RepoSense*:
