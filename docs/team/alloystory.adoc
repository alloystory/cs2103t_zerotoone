== PROJECT: ZeroToOne


== Overview

ZeroToOne is a desktop application that serves as an all-in-one exercise tracker and personal aide. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 26 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Exercise Feature*
** What it does: This feature allows users to create, read, update and delete exercises and exercise sets.

** Justification: The feature formed the base for all the other features to build upon. For example, the Workout feature required exercises to have been created first.

** Highlights: Since this feature forms the base for all other features, the design of this feature will inevitably affect them, as well as features that will be implemented in the future. As such, I ensured that the feature is compliant with the SOLID priciples. All relevant classes are abstracted and well documented, such that each class only has one single responsibility. As such, this allows the Exercise feature to be extensible by any other developers.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Splash Screen*
** What it does: The splash screen will load up first while the application runs through its initialisation process.

** Justification: This enables users to feel that the application is more responsive, enhancing the user experience of the application.

** Highlights: While the application runs locally and the loading process is relatively fast right now, the aim of this enhancement is for future-proofing purposes. It allows developers to further extend the application using other external sources such as an external DBMS, while retaining the "responsiveness" of the application.

** Credits: Some ideas to implement this feature were taken from this https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/deployment/preloaders.htm[tutorial] created by Oracle.
